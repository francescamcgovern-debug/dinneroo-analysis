# Draft Reply to Anna (re: MVP + CD narrative + drop-off)

Hi Anna — quick follow-ups (and thanks Simon for flagging the drop-off point).

## MVP thresholds
- **Broadly supportive**: the additional work still supports the **5/5/20** direction.
- I’ve updated the MVP strengthening write-up so it’s **multi-metric (not just repeat rate)**, with sample sizes and clear **“inflection vs north-star”** framing:
  - `DELIVERABLES/reports/mvp_strengthening_narrative.md`
  - `DELIVERABLES/reports/mvp_strengthening_report.xlsx` (Scorecard tab)
- Simon can walk through how you landed on the recommendation — our analysis is aligned, just adding stronger evidencing and clearer comms.

## Do we need to change the CD deck guidance?
- **No major change to the recommendations** — the research is broadly supportive; what’s new is **more detail + a clearer “where do signals agree / disagree” view**.
- One nuance worth calling out verbally in CD (not necessarily a deck rewrite): **drop-off survey open text shows strong pull for Chinese and Italian/pasta**, which sit alongside the current priorities (Indian/British/Mexican, then Middle Eastern, then Healthy).

## Drop-off requests missing from dish ranking?
You’re right — they weren’t previously surfaced in the ranking view. I’ve now integrated them into the workbook:
- **New columns (Tab 2 – All Metrics):**
  - **Drop-off Requests** (count of drop-off open-text responses mapped to each dish type; n=132 total responses to that question)
  - **Drop-off Demand Signal** (None/Low/Medium/High)
- **New ranking lens (Tab 1 – Ranking Comparison):**
  - **Balanced Rank (incl drop-off)** and **Balanced Shift (incl drop-off)**  
  - This uses **40% demand + 40% family + 20% drop-off** (dish-level mapping only).
- **New tab:** **Drop-off Cuisine Requests** (e.g., “Chinese”, “Italian”) — cuisine-level mentions are kept separate and **not forced into dish-type scoring**.

If helpful I can jump on a quick 10 mins to walk through how to use the new columns/rank so it’s easy to spot what changed vs your baseline.
