# Asian Sub-Demand Analysis

## Key Finding

While Asian remains a single category for MVP tracking (to align with internal tagging), 
recruitment should prioritise specific sub-types based on demand and family satisfaction.

## Demand Leaders (Looker Index)

1. **Pho** (Vietnamese) - Demand Index: 4.2
2. **Sushi** (Japanese) - Demand Index: 1.5
3. **Rice Bowl** (Mixed (Japanese/Korean/Chinese)) - Demand Index: 1.2

## Family Satisfaction Leaders (Kids Full & Happy)

1. **Fried Rice** (Chinese) - 100%
2. **Pho** (Vietnamese) - 89%
3. **Sushi** (Japanese) - 83%

## Sub-Cuisine Representation

| Origin | Dish Count | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Japanese-style | 6 | Strong representation (Katsu, Sushi, Poke) |
| Chinese-style | 3 | Currently only Fried Rice explicitly categorised as Chinese |
| Vietnamese | 1 | Pho - high performer |
| Thai | 1 | East Asian Curry |
| Mixed | 2 | Noodles, Rice Bowl span multiple origins |

## Insight: Chinese Demand May Be Masked

The open-text mining found explicit requests for:
- Chinese cuisine (2 requests)
- Spring rolls (1 request)
- Egg fried rice (1 request)

However, Chinese-style dishes may be ordered under generic categories like "Fried Rice" or "Noodles" 
rather than being tagged as Chinese specifically. This suggests:

1. **Actual Chinese demand may be higher than visible** in cuisine-level reporting
2. **Recruitment opportunity**: Partners offering distinctly Chinese dishes (sweet & sour, chow mein, dim sum) 
   could fill a gap that isn't visible in current framework

## Recommendation

"While Asian remains a single category for MVP tracking, recruitment should prioritise:
1. Vietnamese (Pho) - highest demand + excellent family satisfaction
2. Japanese (Katsu, Sushi) - strong demand, good family fit
3. Chinese-style options - potential unmet demand, consider testing with partners that offer 
   clearly Chinese dishes (sweet & sour, chow mein) to assess true appetite"
