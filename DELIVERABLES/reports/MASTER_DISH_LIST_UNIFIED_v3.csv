# Framework: 60% Performance / 40% Demand
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# KEY CHANGE v3.2: Renamed "Opportunity" to "Demand"
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# PERFORMANCE TRACK (60% of unified score) - Supply-side success
#   orders_per_zone_SCORE (35%) - Orders normalized by zone availability
#   rating_SCORE (15%)          - Deliveroo star rating
#   kids_happy_SCORE (10%)      - % "Full and happy" from post-order survey
#

#   non_dinneroo_SCORE (20%)    - Midweek evening orders outside Dinneroo (proven demand)
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# QUADRANT DEFINITIONS
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Core Driver       = Performance ≥3.0 AND Demand ≥3.0 → WIN: We're capturing proven demand
# Preference Driver = Performance <3.0 AND Demand ≥3.0 → GAP: Demand exists but we're not capturing it
# Demand Booster    = Performance ≥3.0 AND Demand <3.0 → NICHE: We're good but limited market
# Deprioritised     = Performance <3.0 AND Demand <3.0 → AVOID: Neither working nor wanted
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# SCORING METHOD: Percentile-based
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# All factors scored 1-5 using percentile distribution:
#   Top 20% = 5, 60-80% = 4, 40-60% = 3, 20-40% = 2, Bottom 20% = 1
