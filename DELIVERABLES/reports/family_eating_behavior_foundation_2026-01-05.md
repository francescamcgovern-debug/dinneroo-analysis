# Family Eating Behavior Foundation Report

**Date:** 5 January 2026  
**Agent:** Customer/Dish Analysis (Comprehensive)  
**Research Questions:** What do families eat, want, order, enjoy, and need?

---

## Executive Summary

This report answers five foundational questions about family eating behavior using **ALL available data sources** (30+ files, 15,000+ data points). The findings provide the strategic foundation for dish prioritization on Dinneroo.

### Key Insight: The "Balanced Midweek Meal" Opportunity

Dinneroo is positioned for **balanced midweek meals** - nutritious options families feel good about serving on a Tuesday. However:

- Current success is Asian-heavy (Wagamama, Pho, Dishoom = 52% of orders)
- **Nando's** is the #7 most-ordered partner for Dinneroo customers outside Dinneroo (1,299 orders) but is NOT available on Dinneroo
- Families want "something we don't cook at home" (23%) but also "healthy option" (18%) and "familiar dish" (33%)
- The sweet spot: **familiar, balanced, convenient** - not exotic treats

3. **Fresh Pasta is a premium Italian gap**
   - Pasta Evangelists: 414 orders, 57% midweek

     - Roast meats (Three Uncles): 52.2% midweek
     - Noodles (Oodles): 46.3% midweek

### Revised Priority List: DISH TYPES (Not Brands)

**Important:** Think about what families want to eat, not specific brands. The question isn't "should we recruit Nando's?" - it's "should we have Grilled Chicken with Sides on Dinneroo?"

| Priority | Dish Type | What It Represents | Orders | Midweek % | On Dinneroo? |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| 🔴 1 | **Grilled Chicken (Peri-Peri)** | Flame-grilled chicken, customizable sides, perceived healthy | 1,547 | **54.4%** | ❌ NO |
| 🔴 2 | **Healthy Balanced Meals** | Protein + veg + carbs, macro-balanced, guilt-free | 1,009 | **59.8%** | ⚠️ Limited (Farmer J only) |
| 🔴 3 | **Fresh Pasta (Premium)** | Restaurant-quality pasta, comfort food, family shareable | 647 | **52.9%** | ❌ NO |
| 🔴 4 | **Kebabs & Middle Eastern** | Grilled meats, fresh salads, shareable | 650 | **51.7%** | ❌ NO |
| 🟡 5 | **Salads & Grain Bowls** | Light, healthy, customizable | 175 | **69.1%** | ❌ NO |
| 🟡 6 | **Greek & Mediterranean** | Grilled meats, healthy sides, fresh | 220 | **62.3%** | ❌ NO |
| 🟡 7 | **Chinese Dim Sum** | Shareable, variety, family-style | 137 | **60.6%** | ❌ NO |
| 🟡 8 | **Mexican Sharing Plates** | Shareable, customizable, family-friendly | 199 | **56.3%** | ❌ NO |
| 🟡 9 | **Poke & Hawaiian Bowls** | Healthy, customizable, balanced | 279 | **52.7%** | ❌ NO |
| 🟡 10 | **Korean** | Balanced, shareable, growing interest | 89 | **58.4%** | ❌ NO |

### What's Already Working (Dish Types on Dinneroo)

| Dish Type | Orders | Midweek % | Status |
|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Asian Noodles & Rice Bowls | 1,742 | 52.4% | ✅ Strong (Wagamama) |
| Vietnamese Noodle Soups | 1,178 | 52.0% | ✅ Strong (Pho) |
| Indian Curry & Sharing | 785 | 59.4% | ✅ Strong (Dishoom) |
| Pizza & Italian Classics | 1,587 | 51.5% | ✅ Adequate (PizzaExpress) |
| Japanese Fast-Casual | 687 | 50.5% | ✅ Adequate (Itsu) |

### The Reframe

| Instead of thinking... | Think about... |
|------------------------|----------------|
| "Should we recruit Nando's?" | "Do families want **Grilled Chicken with Customizable Sides**?" |
| "Should we recruit Farmer J?" | "Do families want **Healthy Balanced Meals**?" |
| "Should we recruit Pasta Evangelists?" | "Do families want **Fresh Premium Pasta**?" |
| "Should we recruit The Athenian?" | "Do families want **Greek/Mediterranean**?" |

**The answer to all of these is YES** - the data shows families are ordering these dish types midweek, and they're not available on Dinneroo.
