## How to Use This Document

This report provides **two tools** for different purposes:

| Tool | Purpose | Key Question | Go To |
|------|---------|--------------|-------|
| **MVP Zone Framework** | Evaluate if a zone has adequate selection | "Is my zone ready?" | [Section 1](#1-mvp-zone-framework) |
| **Priority Dish List** | Identify what dishes to recruit | "What should I recruit?" | [Section 2](#2-priority-dish-list) |

**The workflow:**

```
Zone Evaluation          Gap Identification          Recruitment
(MVP Framework)    →     (What's missing?)     →    (Priority Dish List)
```

**Key Principle:** Success = families returning happy, not just ordering once. We prioritize repeat rate over volume.

---

## 1. MVP Zone Framework

**Purpose:** Evaluate whether a zone has adequate selection to support growth.

### 1.1 Success Metrics

A zone must meet these thresholds:

| Metric | Threshold | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| **Repeat Rate** | ≥20% | Families find value and return |
| **Rating** | ≥4.3 | Families are satisfied |

### 1.2 Selection Requirements

A zone must have:

| Requirement | Threshold |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Total Cuisines** | 4+ different cuisines |
| **Core Cuisines** | At least 4 of the 5 core cuisines below |
| **Tier 1 Dishes** | At least 3 of the 5 essential dish types |

#### Core Cuisines (Need 4 of 5)

| Cuisine | Priority Dishes | Why Essential |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Italian** | Pizza, Pasta, Garlic Bread | Universal kid appeal, familiar |
| **Indian** | Tikka Masala, Korma (mild), Naan | Great portions, mild options, highest repeat rate |
| **Japanese/Asian** | Teriyaki, Gyoza, Rice Bowls | Top volume, balanced perception |
| **Chicken (Grilled)** | Grilled Chicken + Sides, Wraps | Balanced midweek positioning |
| **Thai/Vietnamese** | Pad Thai, Spring Rolls, Pho | Fresh/healthy perception, adult appeal |

#### Tier 1 Dishes (Need 3 of 5)

| Dish Type | Why Essential |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Grilled Chicken with Customisable Sides** | Perfect balanced midweek meal |
| **Margherita Pizza** | Universal kid-friendly, shareable |
| **Mild Curry with Rice** | Great portions, mild for kids |
| **Pasta Bolognese** | Kid-friendly staple |
| **Rice Bowl with Protein** | Balanced, customisable |

### 1.3 AM Zone Checklist

Quick 8-question evaluation for Account Managers:

1. Do I have a pizza/pasta option? (Italian)
2. Do I have a mild curry option? (Indian)
3. Do I have a rice bowl option? (Asian/Japanese)
4. Do I have a grilled chicken with sides option?
5. Do I have a noodle/fresh option? (Thai/Vietnamese)
6. Is my repeat rate above 20%?
7. Is my average rating above 4.3?
8. Do families have at least 3 different balanced midweek meal options?

| Yes Answers | Status | Action |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| 8 | **MVP Ready** | Focus on growth, not selection |
| 6-7 | **Near MVP** | Fill 1-2 specific gaps |
| 4-5 | **Developing** | Recruit priority cuisines |
| 0-3 | **Early Stage** | Foundational work needed |

### 1.4 MVP Status Summary

| Status | Current Zones | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| MVP Ready | ~21% (43 zones) | Selection is not the blocker |
| Near MVP | ~25% | 1-2 recruits away |
| Developing | ~35% | Significant gaps |
| Early Stage | ~19% | Foundational buildout needed |

---

## 2. Priority Dish List

**Purpose:** Guide recruitment decisions when zones have gaps.

### 2.1 How to Use This List

1. **Identify gaps** using the MVP Zone Checklist above
2. **Check if existing partners** can add the missing dish type
3. **If not, recruit new partners** that serve the dish type

**Think dish types, not brands:** The question isn't "should we recruit Nando's?" - it's "do families want Grilled Chicken with Customizable Sides?"

### 2.2 Tier 1 - Essential Dishes

MVP zones need 3 of these 5 dish types:

| Dish Type | Cuisine | Available? | Recruitment Notes |
|-----------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Grilled Chicken with Customisable Sides | Global | Limited | **Priority gap** - recruit Nando's-style partners |
| Margherita Pizza | Italian | Yes | Widely available |

| Pasta Bolognese | Italian | Yes | Widely available |
| Rice Bowl with Protein (Teriyaki/Katsu) | Asian | Yes | Widely available |

### 4.3 Zone Health Score Components

| Component | Weight | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Repeat Rate | 25% | Behavioral (Snowflake) |
| Survey Satisfaction | 20% | Survey (Post-Order) |
| Kids Happy Rate | 15% | Survey (Post-Order) |
| Star Rating | 15% | Behavioral (Snowflake) |
| Cuisine Coverage | 15% | Catalog |
| Volume | 10% | Behavioral (lowest weight) |

**Full methodology:** See `DOCUMENTATION/METHODOLOGY/02_ZONE_MVP.md`

### 4.4 Key Methodological Notes

1. **Survivorship Bias:** Order volume shows what works among AVAILABLE options, not what families WANT. Supply gaps require latent demand analysis.

2. **Dish Types, Not Brands:** Focus on what families want to eat ("Grilled Chicken with Sides") not specific partners ("Nando's").

3. **Success Over Volume:** A zone with fewer orders but high retention is healthier than a zone with many orders but low retention.

All thresholds are configurable:

- `config/mvp_thresholds.json` - Zone MVP criteria and cuisines
