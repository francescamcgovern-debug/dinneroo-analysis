# Dinneroo MVP Zone Report

**For: Product Director**  
**Date: January 2026**  
**Data: Fresh Snowflake pull 2026-01-05 (80,724 orders)**  
**Purpose: Phase 2 Recruitment Guidance & MVP Status Evaluation**

---

## Executive Summary

This report provides Account Managers with clear criteria to evaluate their zones and identify recruitment priorities. The goal is to reach **MVP status** across all zones, at which point we can confidently say **selection is not the issue** and focus on other growth levers.

### Key Principle

**Success = families returning happy, not just ordering once.**

Order volume is a survivorship bias metric. We prioritize **repeat rate** and **satisfaction** over raw volume.

### Key Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Zones (3+ partners)** | 116 |
| **Total Orders** | 80,724 |
| **MVP Ready** | ~42% |
| **Needs Work** | ~58% |

---

## MVP Definition

A zone is **MVP Ready** when it meets ALL of the following:

### Success Metrics (CRITICAL)

| Criterion | Threshold | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| **Repeat Rate** | ≥35% | Families find value and return |
| **Rating** | ≥4.0 | Families are satisfied (benchmark: 4.2) |

### Selection Requirements (HIGH)

| Criterion | Threshold | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| **Core Cuisines** | 5 of 5 | Covers diverse family preferences |
| **Tier 1 Dishes** | 3 of 5 | Balanced midweek meal options |
| **Partners** | ≥5 | Cuisine redundancy and availability |

## Evaluating Progress to MVP

### How to Know When Selection is "Done"

**Selection is NOT the issue when:**

1. **90%+ zones meet MVP criteria** (currently ~42%)
2. **Repeat rate ≥35%** across all zones
3. **All 5 core cuisines available** in every zone
4. **3+ Tier 1 dish types** in every zone
5. **Variety complaints < 10%** of feedback

### Current Status

```
MVP Progress: ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░ 42%

Zones meeting repeat rate threshold:  ~60%
Zones meeting rating threshold:       95%
Zones meeting cuisine threshold:      42%
Zones meeting Tier 1 dishes:          ~50%
```

### Path to MVP

To reach 90% MVP status:
1. **Focus on repeat rate** as leading indicator
2. **Recruit core cuisines** (Italian, Indian, Asian, Chicken, Thai)
3. **Ensure Tier 1 dishes** are available
4. **Monitor satisfaction** not just volume

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Q1 2026)

1. **Share AM Zone Checklist** with all Account Managers
2. **Recruit Grilled Chicken partners** (biggest gap for balanced midweek meals)
3. **Focus on zones with high volume but low repeat rate** (retention issues)
4. **Ensure £25 family bundles** are available at all partners

### Medium-Term (Q2 2026)

1. **Address Mediterranean/Mexican gaps** (Tier 2 dishes)
2. **Expand to Near MVP zones** for quick wins
3. **Monitor repeat rate** as primary success metric

### When MVP is Reached

Once 90%+ zones are MVP Ready:
1. Selection is no longer the blocker
2. Focus shifts to: marketing, pricing, delivery experience
3. Continue monitoring repeat rate for quality maintenance
