Hi Anna,

**Good news: research largely validates your dish framework.** Most of your tier placements are well-supported by the post-order survey data.

I've also built a comparison tool to see how your rankings would change under different prioritisation approaches - thought it might be useful as we think about strategy.

**What I did:**
- Took your 24 dish types and your demand-based ranking as the baseline ("Anna Rank")
- Created alternative rankings based on:
  - **Family metrics** (kids satisfaction + family suitability from surveys)
  - **Non-family metrics** (satisfaction from couples/singles - relevant if we pivot)
  - **Balanced view** (50% demand + 50% family)
- Added **drop-off survey demand** (open-text “what dishes/cuisines would you like to see more of?”) as an additional lens:
  - **Balanced (incl drop-off)** = 40% demand + 40% family + 20% drop-off requests (dish-level mapping)
  - Cuisine-level requests (e.g., “Chinese”) are summarised separately and not forced into dish-type scoring
- Added "Shift" columns so you can instantly see where each approach differs from your ranking
- Included Test & Learn dishes in Family Rank so you can see where they'd fit

**What the data shows:**

**Dishes that rank HIGHER for families than demand suggests:**
- Shepherd's Pie: Your rank #17 → Family rank #1 (shift +16)
- Casserole/Stew: Not on Dinneroo, but would be #3 by family metrics
- Chilli: Your rank #19 → Family rank #5 (shift +14)

**Dishes that rank HIGHER for non-families (pivot relevant):**
- Poke: Your rank #19 → Non-Family rank #1 (shift +18)
- Fajitas: Your rank #15 → Non-Family rank #1 (shift +14)
- Pho: Your rank #1 → Non-Family rank #7 (still strong)

**Cuisine demand from open-text:**
- Drop-off survey (n=132 dish/cuisine responses) includes strong cuisine-level pull for **Chinese** and **Italian**, plus **Indian** and broader **Asian**
- These cuisine-level mentions are in the workbook on the **“Drop-off Cuisine Requests”** tab

**How to use the workbook:**

**Tab 1 - Ranking Comparison** (start here)
- Your ranking vs Family vs Non-Family vs Balanced - all side by side
- Also includes **Balanced (incl drop-off)** to reflect what non-orderers said they want more of
- Sort by any "Shift" column to find biggest differences
- +ve shift = that approach ranks the dish higher than you did

**Tab 2 - All Metrics** - Full data to sort/filter yourself

**Tab 3 - How Rankings Work** - Explains each approach
  - Includes a note on how drop-off is used, and why cuisine-level requests are kept separate

Happy to walk through!

**Also available if useful:**
- MVP threshold validation (now written as a **multi-metric scorecard**, not repeat-rate-only)
- Asian cuisine sub-analysis (breaking down demand within "Asian" category)
