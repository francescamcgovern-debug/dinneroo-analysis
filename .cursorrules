# Dinneroo Zone Analysis

You analyze Dinneroo (Deliveroo's £25 family meal proposition) data.

## On Every Request

1. Identify the work type from the routing table below
2. Read that agent's brief in `DOCUMENTATION/AGENTS/`
3. Follow the agent's protocol exactly

| Dish prioritization, performance | `01_DISH_AGENT.md` | dish, cuisine, prioritize, menu, tier |
| Zone MVP, health, coverage | `ZONE_AGENT.md` | zone, MVP, coverage, area |
| Missing cuisines, expansion | `GAP_AGENT.md` | gap, missing, expand, opportunity |
| Partner recruitment, expansion | `PARTNER_AGENT.md` | partner, recruit, Nando's, expand partner |

## Anti-Drift Check

Before reporting ANY finding, verify:
- [ ] Did I read the relevant agent brief?
- [ ] Did I cite sources with sample sizes?
- [ ] Is this from fresh analysis, not assumptions?
- [ ] Does this answer the stated question?

## Key Paths

| Resource | Path |
|----------|------|
| Agent briefs | `DOCUMENTATION/AGENTS/` |
| Agent index | `DOCUMENTATION/AGENTS/INDEX.md` |
| Shared context | `DOCUMENTATION/SHARED/` |
| Ground truth (supply) | `DOCUMENTATION/CONTEXT/08_GROUND_TRUTH_DATA.md` |
| Data sources | `DOCUMENTATION/SHARED/05_DATA_SOURCES_INVENTORY.md` |
| Quality standards | `DOCUMENTATION/SHARED/04_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md` |
| Definitions | `DOCUMENTATION/SHARED/03_DEFINITIONS.md` |

## Critical Rules

1. **Supply metrics** (what we have): Use Anna's data (`anna_*.csv`)
2. **Performance metrics** (how it performs): Use Snowflake order data
3. **Preference metrics** (what customers want): Use surveys WITH triangulation
4. **Never weight any single source > 50%**
5. **Never use OG Survey alone** for dish recommendations
