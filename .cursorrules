## Anti-Drift Check

Before reporting ANY finding, verify:
- [ ] Did I read the relevant agent brief?
- [ ] Did I cite sources with sample sizes?
- [ ] Is this from fresh analysis, not assumptions?
- [ ] Does this answer the stated question?

## Key Paths

| Resource | Path |
|----------|------|
| Agent briefs | `DOCUMENTATION/AGENTS/` |
| Agent index | `DOCUMENTATION/AGENTS/INDEX.md` |
| Shared context | `DOCUMENTATION/SHARED/` |
| Ground truth (supply) | `DOCUMENTATION/CONTEXT/08_GROUND_TRUTH_DATA.md` |
| Data sources | `DOCUMENTATION/SHARED/05_DATA_SOURCES_INVENTORY.md` |
| Quality standards | `DOCUMENTATION/SHARED/04_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md` |
| Definitions | `DOCUMENTATION/SHARED/03_DEFINITIONS.md` |
| MVP thresholds (business) | `config/mvp_thresholds.json` |
| MVP inflection analysis | `DATA/3_ANALYSIS/mvp_threshold_discovery.json` |
| Dashboard metrics | `config/dashboard_metrics.json` |
| Zone MVP status | `docs/data/zone_mvp_status.json` |

## Critical Rules

1. **Supply metrics** (what we have): Use Anna's data (`anna_*.csv`)
2. **Performance metrics** (how it performs): Use Snowflake order data
3. **Preference metrics** (what customers want): Use surveys WITH triangulation
4. **Never weight any single source > 50%**
5. **Never use OG Survey alone** for dish recommendations
6. **Zone counts must specify type**: 1,306 = total zones, 434 = supply zones, 201 = live zones with orders
7. **MVP status**: Use established calculations from `docs/data/zone_mvp_status.json` - DO NOT recalculate
