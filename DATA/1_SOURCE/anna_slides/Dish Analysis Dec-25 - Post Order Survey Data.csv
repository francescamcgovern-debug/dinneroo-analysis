You sold them while I was completing my first phase of Almased long term plan which meant that I had to postpone the purchases of the abovementioned Dinneroo meal options till later, and when it was time, you discontinued these most healthy meal options which I was so looking forward to ordering/eating. It's a shame. But the Shepherd's Pie option is kind of suitable too [I need to revamp it to make it fully suitable for my Almased meal recipe], so I have been ordering their Shepherd's Pie.   P.S. I would have ordered ALL my Dinneroo meals from Bill's if they would not have discontinued the Dinneroo option of the abovementioned Thai Green Curry meals.
