### Summary (w/c 13.10.2025)

**OV ramp up continues to be slower than anticipated** \- OV grew 9% WoW (3.6k-3.9k). Likely contributing factors include:

* Marketing impact lag   
* In-app experience changes:  
  * Braze marketing pop up stopped running last week \- *it has since been reinstated (from 13/10)*  
  * Merch card is reaching its impression cap for some users causing it to drop from their view \- *Product is working with relevant teams to align on and implement a new impression cap limit*  
  * Home carousel experiment concluded as planned last week \- *agreed that this would be pinned at position 1 for rest of quarter*

However, we also recognise the need to understand broader adoption and retention barriers and address them proactively. Therefore, next week we will:

* Deep-dive into data trends to generate recommendations on how to adapt our proposition to accelerate adoption  
* Kick off a scaling workstream to explore how we can expand Family Dinneroo beyond incremental proposition iterations

[***Proposition Performance:***](#bookmark=id.8jy7lqj4zkht) No major changes in proposition performance vs previous weeks. 

* **Order Composition**  
  * **Ordering patterns** show the same trends \- rising through the week, 81% ASAP (concentrated 6-6.30pm)/19% scheduled (concentrated same day 4-4.30pm).  
  * **Top performing brands, cuisines and dishes** remain similar to last week \- Pho and Wags dominate; Asian cuisine is most popular (\>50% orders).  
  * **Basket make-up** needs a further deep-dive \- cx are adding 1-2 additional mains to their purchase \>60% of the time contributing to the £34 ATV.  
* **Cx Composition**  
  * **Family split, cx-type and location split** remain consistent with previous weeks. Notably, FTT cx are predominantly existing users (99%) and appear to be higher-frequency cx, with 66% on PLUS and 63% returning to Roo within 7 days of making an FTT purchase.  
* **Cx Behaviour \-** Chloe to follow up on deep-dive on cx behaviour (in snowflake) \- specifically: (i) Customer funnel \- total customers reached, conversion rates at each stage, and key drop-off points (ii) Segmentation \- cx and OV split into new-to-FTT vs returning-to-FTT (iii) Cross-view \- proportion of cx new-to-rx.

**Media Insights:** Remainder of planned content live this week, with hero talent going live across YouTube/Meta, fulfilling the planned marketing launch of Dinneroo. Early indications of influencer engagement and Meta reach are slightly up vs expectations, and we will have an initial steer on podcast/audio results next week. Challenges around setting up “Family Time” event tracking have prompted a discussion around changing the Conversion Lift Study, reverting back to standard “purchase” events tag \- limiting tracking ability, but enabling quicker activation of activity.

**DXGY:** 4.6k Cx have entered in total, 10% of those have placed their second order with 67 Cx completing all steps. To date, £1675 vouchers have been earned, with spend to date £375 (vs total budget £1m). 

**CRM:** Minor reporting error affecting email only discovered, meaning that previous data reported on CTR is unreliable. This week, we relaunched the FT Pop-up and kicked off the Day of the Week Test, sending email and push on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, with results shared below in deep dive. Session conversion, resulting in Dinneroo orders from email is 1.3% (21 orders), and 0.2% from push (8 orders). We will continue to track attributed orders as a success metric in following MBRs.

In order to continue driving engagement, we are planning the creation of solus emails for November, as a fresh way to share the value proposition to Cx.

[***Operations Performance***](#bookmark=id.xaawvvkuqgme) ***and [Care:](#bookmark=id.2bly6deyk5rk)*** Slight improvements in service metrics, but similar challenges persist

**B10s:** 

* B10s continue to be elevated vs. Non-Dinneroo mealtimes; B10s have decreased WoW (-0.73 ppt WoW to 11.14%). This is being driven by unacceptable lates decreasing \-1.05 ppt to 6.74%, RWT has continued to decrease vs prior weeks, \-0.50 ppt to 7.2% (lowest yet but 2.7 ppt above Non-Dinneroo rate of 4.4%).   
* The worst performing partners who received more than five orders were Xian Street Food (25%), Kokoro (17.4%) and Farmer J (15.7%).    
* Ten partners have been flagged for a disproportionately high number of RWT or OI issues compared to their non-Dinneroo orders, with follow-up actions underway, and actions being reviewed in Operating Theatre which continues with AM, CD and Px Ops attendance. 

**Care:**

* **Claims:** improving trends vs prior week at 6.52% orders with a claim (-0.04 ppt WoW) and average claim amount at £14.09 (-16p WoW), however the highest CCPO claim reason of Missing Items did increase \+2p to £0.24 \- a watchout for Commercial teams  
* **OTP:** OTP is 20p per Dinneroo order (-15p WoW), which is \+10p above [target](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1VI8MI8jZlmiXNNKKB_cWaeiW9eH3rQ-LK4Gbrv_FJsw/edit) (10p) and \-1p below budget (21p).

* **Order Composition**  
  * **Ordering patterns:** Same trends as in previous week. Order volumes rise through the week. Split 81% ASAP/19% scheduled. ASAP orders build over 4.30-6.30pm (highest 6.00-6.30pm), while scheduled orders are primarily same day (\>90%) and highest 4-4.30pm.  
  * **Top performing brands:** No change in top 5 brands vs last week: Pho, Wags, Dishoom, PEX, Banana Tree.   
  * **Top performing cuisines**: Similar cuisine trends vs last week: Asian dominates (\>50% incl. Thai and Vietnamese), followed by Indian, Italian and British.  
  * **Top performing dishes:** No change in top 3 dishes vs last week: Wags Family Chicken Katsu, Pho’s Pho the Whole Family and Dishoom’s Chicken Ruby. Next popular are Pho’s It’s a curry night and PEXs Family Favourites Feast.  
  * **Basket make-up:** Over half (55%) of cx are adding an additional main to their purchase; 7% are adding 2 *\-\> dig into next week.*  
* **Cx Composition**  
  * **Family split:** No change per LBDS \- but LBDS is significantly underreporting families \-\> *DS undertaking family identification workstream Q4 ‘25.*  
  * **Cx-type (existing and frequent) \-** 99% of FTT cx are existing-to-platform. 66% have PLUS and 63% return to Roo within 7 days of making an FTT purchase \- indicating that adoption is being driven primarily by more frequent, high-engagement customers **\-\>** *deep-dive into FTT cx profile to understand how their spend and AOF index vs the broader customer base.*  
  * **Location:** Similar to previous weeks, with FTT OV composition by region closely aligns to total Roo GTV composition by region, over indexing slightly in the South and under indexing in CL.  
* **Cx Behaviour**  
  * Chloe to follow up on deep-dive on cx behaviour (in snowflake) \- specifically:  
    * Customer funnel \- total customers reached, conversion rates at each stage, and key drop-off points  
    * Segmentation \- cx and OV split into new-to-FTT vs returning-to-FTT  
    * Cross-view \- proportion of cx new-to-rx

**Next Steps** 

* Deep-dive into data trends to generate recommendations on how to adapt our proposition to accelerate adoption. Specifically, we will analyse:  
  * **Ordering behaviour:** When cx place orders, and the implications for when our proposition is active and when we communicate it.  
  * **Cx journey:** Key trends and drop-off points, and how we can mitigate them.  
  * **Cx profile:** Who is ordering \- to determine who we should be targeting and how best to do so.  
  * **Order composition:** What cx are ordering, and how this should inform adjustments to dishes, pricing, and add-ons (with px implications longer-term).  
  * **Cx and px feedback**: What we’re hearing, and what that suggests for evolving our proposition across dishes, pricing and add-ons.  
* Kick off a scaling workstream to explore how we can expand Family Dinneroo beyond incremental proposition iterations.

### 

### This week we launched the remainder of our content with more organic & paid influencers, podcasts, and hero talent going live on YouTube/ Meta. Our marketing rollout has been delivered to plan with all channels now live. We will continue to share channel-specific headlines weekly in the WBR on Friday’s (Link to weekly marketing results [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Epw1f4xddHHvC1jfIowJ_p3m-0-YAguc9MpMPowMc3I/edit?usp=sharing)). In summary:

* It is still early days to (a) see full impact of activity and (b) understanding channel results in full  
* We are seeing green shoots come through with positive influencer engagement & meta launch reach slightly up vs expectations  
* Next week we will be adding podcast & digi audio to result summary  
* Growth social update:  
  * Engineers are still working through setting up the “Family Time” event and they’ve communicated that further delays are expected. As a reminder an event tag enables us to track specific orders (in this case Family Time).  
  * Due to this we are proposing to change our CLS (conversion lift study) and revert back to standard “purchase” events tag for the time being, i.e. we will track all Deliveroo orders that the growth activity has driven.  
  * This will have an impact on our ability to track specific FT orders in the short term (as we continue to push engineering on the set up) but it will allow us to get this activity live sooner in-market and we can apply proxies to historical activity.  
  * We are proactively briefing in Meta now and we hope to be able to set live on Monday (20th) if aligned.

### As a reminder we also have the following sessions planned to review \-

* ### **23 October:** We will share more detail on media planning scenarios to support FT in H1 in existing H1 budget planning meeting

* ### **W/C 17 November:** In campaign analysis \~6 weeks after launch (1-hour) 

* ### **W/C 25 January:** full PCA (1.5-hour) \- in depth overview channel specific performance and full results from geo hold-out group experiment 

* ### **Mid-Feb**: MMM results delivered with Family Time specific insights

**CRM:**   
*Correction on last week’s WBR*  
Last week we reported that CTR for FT emails had dropped compared to previous weeks (0.1% vs 0.3%). We’ve since discovered a reporting error affecting email only — some click data was missing for the period October 4–14, meaning CTR figures for this timeframe are under-represented. Given the scale of the fix required, we won’t be able to retrospectively update the data, so the correct CTRs for the past two weeks will not be available. We will monitor CTR of upcoming sends to understand if we are actually seeing a drop in FT. 

This week, we relaunched the FT Pop-up and kicked off the Day of the Week Test, sending email and push on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday. We’ll share the initial results of the XP in next week’s report. Results for Week 7 in table below are impacted by the CTR issue mentioned above, as well as set-up error on Tuesday that impacted the deliverability of a portion of push notifications. 

In order to continue driving engagement, we are planning the creation of solus emails for November, as a fresh way to share the value proposition to Cx.

**Search:**  
MTD search has delivered 308,254 impressions, resulting in 5,104 clicks and 506 attributed orders. **CTR stands at 1.63% (vs. avg CTR 8.37% Rx campaigns)** & a total spend to date of £11,447.

We’ve made adjustments to the search strategy with a focus on improving relevancy and engagement. Specifically, we have refined keyword targeting by shifting from broad match to exact and phrase match types. This change has increased CTR by 0.06% and addressed the issue of overly broad search terms that previously drove lower CTR. By concentrating on delivery related and branded terms (e.g., “Dinneroo”), as well as tighter keyword control, we expect to see stronger alignment between user intent and ad messaging, however, spend will be restricted. This should in turn help improve CTR and overall campaign efficiency.

B10s continue to be elevated vs. Non-Dinneroo mealtimes; B10s have decreased WoW (-0.73 ppt WoW to 11.14%). This is being driven by unacceptable lates decreasing \-1.05 ppt to 6.74%, RWT has continued to decrease for the 7th week in a row \-0.50 ppt to 7.2% (lowest yet but 2.7 ppt above Non-Dinneroo rate of 4.4%). The worst performing partners who received more than five orders were Xian Street Food (25%), Kokoro (17.4%) and Farmer J (15.7%). 

Top RWT contributors continue to be PizzaExpress (15.0% RWT w/ 36.5% contribution), Banana Tree (10.9% RWT w/ 25.0% contribution) and Farmer J (15.7% RWT w/ 7.7% contribution

OI increased WoW 0.46 ppt to 3.32% ( \+1.43 ppt above non-Dinneroo OI rate of 1.89%). 

- Prezzo continued to have high OI at 31.58%, with Las Iguanas (10.00%) and LEON (8.00% also sitting in the worst performers)  
- Top OI contributors continue to be Wagamama (4.84% OI w/ 25.26% contribution), Pho (3.10% OI w/ 18.95% contribution) and PizzaExpress (4.69% OI w/ 12.63% contribution). 

This week, Px Ops flagged five partners as a focus in the Px Mobilisation tracker, these were then discussed in detail on the bi-weekly Operating Theatre:  

* PizzaExpress:  
  * RWT increased WoW, mainly driven by low order volume, meaning that the bespoke dishes are taking longer to prep due to lack of familiarity.   
  * Action plan discussed with Px: PEX thinking of launching an initiative to give sites free family Dinneroo meals for them to cook and take home so that they can practice and familiarise themselves with the dishes and prep times. Also reviewing the option to offer Dinneroo menu items outside of Dinneroo times to increase OV to increase familiarity. PEx are discussing internally, update to be shared next week  
* Pho \- Four focus sites with consistent performance issues. Also reviewing the labelling of packaging  
* Farmer J:  
  * OI is driven by Farringdon (21%), Hammersmith (13%) and St James Park (10%) sites. Average app rating for all sites remains \>4.5\*.   
  * Actions taken by AM: Placed test orders from problem sites, Had a call with their Ops Director, GM and Founder last Friday to get to the root cause & decide an action plan, Site visits unveiled that Dinneroo orders are a low priority at 4:30 to 5:30 due to preparation for peak times \- insights will be shared at QBR so that it hits senior management discussion   
* Wagamama:  
  * Cause identified: Embedding period \- finding a trend where missing items are driven by additional ordered items to the FTT proposition as they require another bag.   
  * Actions taken: Sharing worst sites with ops team who are working closely with restaurants to improve, including phone calls to Area and General Managers. These issues have been raised at the MBR, as this includes Wagamama C-suite.   
* Dishoom:  
  * Battersea Editions had an increase in RWT, this is driven by orders being marked ready but then held in the kitchen before being taken to the communal dispatch area. This has been discussed with the Ops Director this week, he will take this away as a discussion point with the site manager \- also been flagged to our Editions team.   
    

Across all partners, the most common issues continue to be:

- **Missing Items or Components:** Entire dishes, sides, sauces, or key garnishes not included; portions not sufficient for the advertised family size. (Bill's, Dishoom, Giggling Squid, Itsu, Kricket, LEON, PizzaExpress, Wagamama)  
-   
- **Spillage & Packaging Failures:** Leaked sauces/curries, split or open containers, ripped/cracked bags, broken boxes leading to contamination or loss of food. (Banana Tree, Cocotte, Dishoom, Farmer J, Giggling Squid, Kricket, Milano, Pho, PizzaExpress, Wagamama)  
-   
- **Wrong or Incorrect Items:** Completely wrong orders/brands, swapped items or proteins (e.g., tofu ↔ chicken), toppings/allergens included against request. (Dishoom, Itsu, Pho, PizzaExpress, Prezzo, Wagamama)  
-   
- **Poor Food Quality & Cooking Issues:** Soggy/chewy/overcooked/cold items; spoiled/muddy produce; quality or portions not matching description. (Banana Tree, Bella Italia, Bill's, Giggling Squid, Kricket, Pho, PizzaExpress, Prezzo, Wagamama)

### 4\. Care ([Chloe Hobson](mailto:chloe.hobson@deliveroo.co.uk))

#### A) Claims

The following data is an overall view of Dinneroo order Care performance, and therefore includes OTP data. A more granular deep dive on OTP metrics is in the section below.

| Highest CCPO claim reason (per FTT orders) | Missing items (£0.24) | Missing items (£0.22) | \+£0.02 | \+£0.10 ⬆️ |

#### B) On-Time Promise 

This week’s gross OTP performance is **20p per Dinneroo order** (-15p WoW), which is **\+10p above [target](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1VI8MI8jZlmiXNNKKB_cWaeiW9eH3rQ-LK4Gbrv_FJsw/edit)** (10p) and **\-1p below budget** (21p). Overall we have seen lower daily OTP CPO as a result of lower B10 Unacceptable Lates (15+ mins), however there is minimal room for error above the budget line based on current performance, therefore operational impacts (e.g. poor weather) could easily push OTP above budget.

| OTP average claim amount | £38.46 | £30.52 | £32.94 |  |  |  |

PTD \= performance to date from OTP launch on 6th October

\*We have been informed of a known issue on OTP metrics where the ETA upper bound for a small volume (\~3%) of orders is not being published, resulting in a potential under-reporting of OTP eligible orders. This impact is expected to be very low because it is impacting 4% of **all** orders and so only a very small percentage of total orders will be Dinneroo & delivered late. In addition, this issue **will not** impact the number of orders **claimed** for OTP and therefore will not impact the compensation and CPO metrics.

#### B) AOV/meal size Deep dive follow up ([Polina Popova](mailto:polina.popova@deliveroo.co.uk))

This is a quick follow up for the previous deep dive focused on AOV and meal size of FTT meals. The insights are not actionable at this point, it aims at understanding how actual user behavior aligns with what we imagine it should be.

**3 main ideas:**

- Only 61% of orders are just FTT meal (+4% where user adds drink/dessert)  
- In 50% of orders customers spent roughly what they used to, in 25% they saved money and in 25% they spent more  
- 11% of orders were done by customers who are quite used to ordering in the FTT timeframe (Mon \-Thu early evenings)

More details:

- In a previous meeting I have shown that there are many customers with order value more than £25. I have bucketed orders into 5 buckets according to meal/party size:

  **61% \- Bucket 1 \-  just one FTT meal** 

    4% \- Bucket 2 \- FTT meal \+ drink/dessert

  **26% \- Bucket 3 \- FTT meal \+ either 1-2 small plates or one extra main**

    7% \- Bucket 4 \- 2 FTT meals or FTT meal \+ 2 mains etc

    1% \- Bucket 5 \-  very large orders

- We discussed 4 main hypothesis of why this can happen:

  1\) Gold Plus customers are encouraged to order above £30

  2\) Some restaurants are better in upselling than others

  3\) May be family is just more than 4 people

  4\) They are not sure about the size or they want to have more leftovers for next day


We can look into the first 3 hypotheses with data we have, the 4th one is not possible to explore with data.   
 

- Gold plus customers’ orders are indeed exceeding £30 more frequently but this it is not having a major impact in overall picture:  
1)  The difference between the percentage of orders above vs. below £30 is only 5 p.p. for Gold vs. not-Gold customers  
2) Only 20% of FTT orders are orders by Gold customers 

- Looking at restaurant level is a bit tricky at the moment because numbers are still too low. Nonetheless, most restaurants have roughly the same distribution of orders per bucket. Among top 5 there are two interesting cases with Bucket 1 being larger (74% vs 61%) and Bucket 3 being smaller:  
  - Pho: they have a very detailed menu where  customers choose specific meals for adults and kids in the FTT offer  
  - Banana Tree: all their FTT meals are £20

		(those might not be the reasons, just potential reasons)

- Some families might just be larger. We can look at past user orders and compare them to FTT orders (only looking into EC):  
  - Comparing FTT order value vs  the customer’s AOV in 2025 (on order level):  
    - 50% of FTT orders are within \+-£5 of the customer’s AOV  
    - The rest of distribution is very symmetrical: 13% in each of 4 buckets: £5-10, \>£10,  \-£10 to \-£5, \<-£10  
    - **Meaning that in 50% of orders customers spent their usual amount, in 25% saved money and in 25% spent more than usual**  
    - Logically, this differs per bucket. Percent of orders with customers spending their usual amount or saving:  
      - Bucket 1: 86%  
      - Bucket 3: 60%  
      - Bucket 5: only 3% so those are really one-off large orders  
  - Looking into number of customer’s orders in FTT timeframe (Mon-Thu evening, I tool slightly larger window) pre-FTT starting from June (so roughly 3 months):  
    - 0 orders: 25%  
    - 1-3 orders: 40%  
    - 4-10 orders: 25%  
    - \>10 orders: 11% \- **likely cannibalisation from the customer perspective**. 

### 6\. Financial Update ([Johanne Soeun Chu](mailto:johanne.chu@deliveroo.com)) 

### 

### ***For the September month review, please refer to [2025.10.02 Family Dinneroo WBR (W5)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eqBaMcrRcCiY3yQbcDN-Ss_xIZCCFniyBP-6xL9GYIw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.6zul8530v2ov)***

Rather than profit (GPPO), I have changed the focus of this section to be on top-line growth only. 

September (i.e., soft launch) recorded average weekly OV of 2.7k. Our first MarComms week (week of Oct 6\) recorded weekly OV of 3.6k (+34% from soft launch). Based on partial week data (as of Oct 15 close), this week is at 2.8K OV, or 3.7K on run rate-basis (+40% from soft launch). While this is promising early signs of ramp-up, we are 94% behind our weekly Q4 target of 68k OV. This is partly because Sep underperformed vs target (11k OV vs 84k expected), so now we require higher levels in remaining months to hit 2025 landing of 897K Gross OV and £25M Gross GTV (£17.4M Net GTV, assuming 30% cannibalization). October Gross OV is expected to land 96% behind target (gap wider due to first week being pre MarComms). 

The primary challenge continues to be in Families conversion rate (0.3% vs 10% for EC Families). 

**Please note that for v2 Planning submission, Central Marketing F\&S is requesting weekly Cx retention curves in order to do analysis on Marketing Spend / newly acquired FTT Cx vs the value of an FTT Cx (avg retention rate % \* AOF \* GPPO). The intention is to validate the proposed marketing spend for 2026\. We will work with [Chloe Morgan](mailto:chloe.morgan@deliveroo.co.uk)on this.**
