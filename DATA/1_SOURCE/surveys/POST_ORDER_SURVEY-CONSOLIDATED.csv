You sold them while I was completing my first phase of Almased long term plan which meant that I had to postpone the purchases of the abovementioned Dinneroo meal options till later, and when it was time, you discontinued these most healthy meal options which I was so looking forward to ordering/eating. It's a shame. But the Shepherd's Pie option is kind of suitable too [I need to revamp it to make it fully suitable for my Almased meal recipe], so I have been ordering their Shepherd's Pie.   P.S.

The other restaurants (Bella Italia, farmer js and many others) simply do not have enough food for a family, the amount of food barely hit 2000 calories for majority of these partners restaurants and the price is very similar to individual portions so they're not really understanding the requirements that it's for a family of 4 minimum. Majority of the food would only be enough for 2 adults to be filled so their parents have to eat less to ensure the kids get enough food for dinner. Dishoom and Banana tree absolutely nails the family dinners because there's enough calories and nutrition and value for money for the entire family. Dishoom and banana tree are high end aswell compared to a lot of these other restaurants and they understand and fulfil the requirements whereas some of these other restaurants are just over priced with small portions like farmer js. ",Bella Italias pasta was very dry barely any sauce and small portions. Farmer js portion size is ridiculously small you're better off buying 2 of their individual trays then the family meal. Any restaurant serving under 4000 calories for a family dineroo that caters to a family of 4 should either be removed or change their portion sizes because some of them charge £25 and it's barely enough for 2 people let alone a family. ,,,"They ate some parts of the dish, but not as much as I wanted","They ate some parts of the dish, but not as much as I wanted","They ate some parts of the dish, but not as much as I wanted","They ate some parts of the dish, but not as much as I wanted",,The portion size wasn't enough. That's all it comes down to for majority of these restaurants. Bella Italia lacked sauce so the pasta was dry. Banana tree and Dishoom are the only ones hitting the mark for size and value. The other restaurants on the list lack calories it's easier for me to just cook at home if these other restaurants can't even provide over 2000 calories for a family dinner it's a bit ridiculous especially for something simple like grains or pasta which are cheap as it is. ,Neutral,Better quality and larger portions. ,,,Strongly agree,Strongly disagree,Neutral,"Deliveroo need to set requirements with partner restaurants for family dineroo to ensure there are enough calories to feed a family of 4 minimum. Every single restaurant needs to take notes from Dishoom and banana tree. Also, Deliveroo need to put the 30% on these restaurants every Wednesday not as a one time per restaurant thing it sort of ruins it because if you've enjoyed a restaurant you want to order again on a Wednesday and enjoy the 30% discount not try somewhere new which isn't as good. If I've ordered a family dineroo from one restaurant and believe it's very good then I look forward to the 30% off on a Wednesday which shouldn't be a one per restaurant offer it should remain because then I could just order it any other day of the week.
