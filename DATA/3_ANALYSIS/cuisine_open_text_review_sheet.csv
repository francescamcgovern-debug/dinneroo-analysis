POST_ORDER_SURVEY-CONSOLIDATED.csv,827,"Overall, how could this dish be improved to suit your needs better?",I think that this particular dish came across as appetising due to its advertised crispy panko chicken which was appetising indeed while the curry sauce option was not appetising enough for my palate. Won't order it again and I would have ordered from Bill's if they would have included their former Thai Green Curry Dinneroo options which they used to have.

You sold them while I was completing my first phase of Almased long term plan which meant that I had to postpone the purchases of the abovementioned Dinneroo meal options till later, and when it was time, you discontinued these most healthy meal options which I was so looking forward to ordering/eating.
