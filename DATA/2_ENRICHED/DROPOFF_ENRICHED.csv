Initially this sounded like a great idea, I had injured my leg at work and was not able to easily weight bear on my leg so getting a takeaway as a treat sounded like a good idea to myself and my partner. How wrong we were.    We ordered from PHO Stratford and ordered the pho the whole fam which included: Prawn crackers, egg fried rice, beef brisket pho noodle soup, cook-fried noodles with chicken and spicy beef brisket pho noodle soup. We also ordered two sides additionally of Crispy pork spring rolls and chicken summer rolls.  The crispy pork spring roles were missing from the order.   When the order arrived I had to go down to meet the delivery person. The delivery driver had a cool bag with our order inside (which was inside a pho paper bag). The driver pulled the paper bag out of the cool bag and while doing so said 'Its leaking' he then put the paper bag on the floor. I could see the who had leaked all over the order, ruining all of the food and had broken the bag. The pho was now leaking all over the floor. The driver quickly pulled away the paper bag and said 'please don't complain about me' and went back to his moped and drove off. I was left in the street with all of the food (out of the bag) and ruined as it was covered in the pho liquid. The food was ruined and when I spoke with deliveroo agent on the chat they stated that I should get a full refund of £36.43 due to the whole order being ruined and that they would make a complaint about the driver. I never received a refund and when I chased this up the agent/deliveroo email stated that I will not receive a refund. I  t's absolutely appalling, I had all of the photographic evidence of the food ruined, the missing items from the order (Pork crispy spring rolls), and the driver was awful and to not be refunded was even worse.   I also made another order on Deliveroo on 21st DECEMBER 2025 from Daddy's kebab where myself and my partner ordered set1 Daddy's home alone kebab twice. These were supposed to come with chips and neither did. Again I took photos of the menu where it states that these meals should come with chips, phoned the restaurant who apologised and said that they had been really busy and didn't put the chips in. I took it up with a deliveroo agent via chat stating that we didn't receive the chips, that the restaurant had confirmed this over the phone and even provided the agent with the restaurant number for them to confirm. However we did not receive compensation/ a refund on this occasion as apparently there wasn't enough evidence (we had photographic evidence of the lack of chips with both orders)  Overall deliveroo quality has declined significantly. The drivers drive too fast (I see them on the road speeding and driving dangerously and on their mobile phones. The food spills, items are missed and when you make a legitimate claim to Deliveroo you are not compensated. It is an absolutely awful experience and food ordering system.
