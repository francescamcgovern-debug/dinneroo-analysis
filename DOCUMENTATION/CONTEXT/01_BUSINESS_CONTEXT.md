# Business Context

## What is Dinneroo?

**Dinneroo** (also known as "Family Dinneroo" or "Feed the Family for £25") is Deliveroo's family meal proposition:

- **Price Point:** £25 fixed price
- **Original Target:** Families with children
- **Value Prop:** Restaurant-quality family meals, convenient weeknight dinners
- **Launched:** September 2024
- **Time Window:** 4:30pm - 6:30pm (weekdays)

### Core Positioning: Balanced Midweek Meals

**Dinneroo is designed for BALANCED MIDWEEK MEALS** - not indulgent weekend treats.

This positioning has implications for partner and dish selection:
- Families want nutritious options they feel good about serving on a Tuesday
- "Balanced" doesn't mean boring - it means protein + veg + carbs in reasonable proportions
- Partners like **Nando's** (grilled chicken, sides, balanced meals) fit this positioning well
- Pure "treat" food (pizza, burgers) may underperform the core value prop

### Ideal Partner Profile

Partners that align with the balanced midweek meal positioning:
- **Nando's** - Grilled chicken, customizable sides, perceived as "healthier fast food"
- **Pho** - Noodle soups with protein and vegetables
- **Wagamama** - Rice/noodle bowls with protein and veg
- **Dishoom** - Balanced Indian meals with protein, rice, sides

Partners that may be positioning mismatches:
- Pizza chains (indulgent, not "balanced")
- Burger joints (weekend treat positioning)
- Heavy fried food options

## Stakeholders & Their Questions

| Stakeholder | Primary Question |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Product Director** | Who loves Dinneroo and why? |
| **Partner Ops** | What makes a zone successful? |
| **Commercial** | Which partners/dishes/cuisines should we prioritize? |
| **Marketing** | Who should we target and with what message? |

## The Core Research Question

> **"What makes a perfect zone in terms of partners, dishes, and cuisines?"**

This breaks down into:
1. How many partners does a zone need?
2. Which dishes are essential?
3. Which cuisines must be represented?
4. What's the relationship between supply and satisfaction?
5. Are there "must-have" vs "nice-to-have" elements?

## Business Constraints

| Constraint | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| £25 price point | Cannot change without major revision |
| Partner agreements | Portion standards require negotiation |
| Zone expansion | Requires partner development, not new recruitment |

## What This Project Should Deliver

1. **Zone success criteria** - What distinguishes high-performing zones?
2. **Partner/dish/cuisine requirements** - Minimum viable zone composition
3. **Gap analysis** - Which zones are missing what?
4. **Prioritization framework** - Where to focus expansion efforts
